# Data Ingestion System for AdvertiseX

## Introduction

This project is part of the data engineering efforts at AdvertiseX, a digital advertising technology company specializing in programmatic advertising. The focus here is on the data ingestion system designed to handle vast amounts of data generated by ad impressions, clicks, conversions, and more.

## Overview

The data ingestion system is built to efficiently collect and process data from various sources in different formats, including JSON, CSV, and Avro. Our approach involves:

- **Real-time Data Streams:** Utilizing Kafka for handling high-throughput real-time data streams.
- **Batch Data Processing:** Employing tools like NiFi (or AWS Glue) for batch processing needs.
- **Schema Management:** Implementing a Schema Registry for managing Avro schemas, ensuring data compatibility and evolution.

## Data Ingestion Strategy

1. **Kafka for Real-time Streams:** Configured Kafka to ingest real-time data streams of ad impressions, clicks, and conversions.
2. **Batch Processing:** Set up NiFi/AWS Glue for efficient batch processing of bid requests and other batch data sources.
3. **Schema Registry:** Utilized a Schema Registry to manage and validate Avro schemas for bid requests, ensuring data integrity across the system.
