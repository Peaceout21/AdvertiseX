# Message Queue Strategy

## Purpose
Define the strategy for using message queues to manage error messages, warnings, and informational logs in a scalable and efficient manner.

## Tools
- **Amazon SQS**: Primary tool for queuing messages for asynchronous processing.

## Strategy
- **Error Handling**: Queue error messages for processing by dedicated Lambda functions, which can categorize and store errors or trigger notifications.
- **Load Balancing**: Use SQS to distribute processing loads evenly across multiple consumers.
- **Decoupling**: Decouple the generation of messages from the processing, enhancing system resilience and scalability.

## Best Practices
- Implement dead-letter queues to handle message processing failures.
- Monitor queue lengths to adjust processing capacity as needed.
- Ensure message visibility timeouts are configured according to processing time requirements.
