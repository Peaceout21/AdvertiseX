# Error Handling Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the approach for detecting, logging, and resolving errors within the AdvertiseX data processing pipelines.

## Strategy
- **Detection**: Use AWS CloudWatch and Lambda functions to monitor and detect errors in real-time.
- **Logging**: Log detailed error information in CloudWatch Logs for analysis.
- **Resolution**: Implement automated resolution mechanisms where feasible. For complex issues, escalate to the engineering team for manual intervention.

## Tools
- **AWS CloudWatch**: For error detection and logging.
- **AWS Lambda**: For executing error processing logic.
- **Amazon SNS**: For notifying stakeholders of critical errors.

## Best Practices
- Ensure comprehensive logging of errors for troubleshooting.
- Define clear escalation paths for unresolved errors.
- Regularly review error logs and metrics to identify patterns and address systemic issues.
